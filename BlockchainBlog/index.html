	<p>	When blockchain came to be discussed as a niche
technology, it was from the standpoint of currency and
Bitcoins. Blockchain 1.0, as it is also known in some circles,
heralded an era of cryptocurrencies, enabling people to
make transactions bypassing standard currencies.
Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, and AltCoin
made use of blockchain’s growing list of records (blocks) to
verify transactions using distributed ledgers. As each
transaction comes with a timestamp and can be verified
permanently, blockchain gave rise to peer-to-peer financial
services. Within no time, savvy entrepreneurs began to
provide services ranging from currency transfers to
remittances made online. In other words, Blockchain 1.0
ushered a radical digital payment system that the world
wasn’t yet prepared for. So much so that it felt subversive
and almost destabilizing to traditional financial and banking
institutions. </p>

  <p>  The evolution of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin encouraged
traditional banking and financial institutions to adopt
blockchain as well. Blockchain 2.0 garnered the interest of
every C-level executive and that of every investor.Very
quickly, blockchain’s applications rose above and beyond
financial transactions, and it became the de facto method to
manage contracts. As each transaction is immutable, and
distributed ledgers can’t be tampered with, governments,
real estate agencies, financial institutions, and even health
entities started to use blockchain to verify identities and
information, manage contracts, and ensure safety and
security. This was the era of Smart Contracts, tiny computer
programs that remain embedded in the blockchain, that
automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce contract
performance. Ethereum Blockchain is a popular Smart
Contract service that many would recognize. </p>

    <p>Currently, we are in Blockchain 3.0, which is dominated by
decentralized applications also known as DApp. DApps
make use of blockchain’s decentralized communication and
storage to run backend codes. What started as a
cryptocurrency tool evolved into a contract management
method. Currently, blockchain’s decentralized models have
given rise to cultural shifts, that involve verification sans
human intervention. As the human activity of all sorts is
vulnerable to falsification, trustless technologies such as
blockchain provide the solution that the world needs today.
DApps have resulted in blockchain being used to achieve
consensus, verify using digital IDs, protect IPs, manage
media, and enhance governance and healthcare. In other
words, blockchain is no longer limited to currency, market,
or contracts. It is now used Blockchain’s evolution has
helped modern businesses to meet various demands that
previously were unattainable. Blockchain has made it easier
for automation, ERP, and software integration easier and
more trustworthy.</p> </div>
